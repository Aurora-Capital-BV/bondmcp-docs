## 1. Project Overview

### Mission and Vision
BondMCP is a comprehensive platform designed to transform complex and often unstructured health data into validated, actionable decisions. The core mission of BondMCP is to provide a unified "language" that can be understood and trusted by diverse systems, including wearables, hospital EMRs, consumer health applications, and laboratory information systems. By enforcing rigorous cross-model validation (utilizing a minimum of three Large Language Models), semantic grounding through verifiable sources, and offering public APIs, BondMCP aims to become the internet's trust layer for health. This ensures that insights and recommendations derived from health data are not only intelligent but also reliable and precise, fostering greater confidence in AI-driven healthcare solutions.

### Key Domains
The BondMCP ecosystem is primarily accessed through distinct domains:
*   `api.bondmcp.com`: Serves as the developer portal, offering an API explorer, downloadable SDKs, demonstrations of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, and comprehensive documentation.
*   `my.bondmcp.com`: Provides a user interface demonstration, including an AI-powered health chat, an API sandbox environment for testing, billing management, and API key generation.
*   `bondmcp.com`: Functions as the main marketing and informational website, featuring product details, a waitlist for new users, and onboarding materials.

## 2. System Architecture

### High-Level Design
The BondMCP system is architected as a robust, cloud-native platform leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability, reliability, and security. The architecture is designed to support a high volume of API requests, complex data processing, and real-time interactions, while ensuring data integrity and compliance with health data standards.

### Backend Services (FastAPI)
The backend of BondMCP is built using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance Python web framework. This choice allows for rapid development, automatic data validation, and interactive API documentation generation (following OpenAPI standards). The backend services are containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate for serverless compute. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming traffic across the ECS tasks.

Key backend responsibilities include API endpoint management, Trust Layer logic implementation, data processing and orchestration (including calls to LLMs via AWS Bedrock), database interaction with Aurora PostgreSQL (using pgvector), and integration with AWS Cognito for authentication.

### Frontend Applications (Next.js)
The primary frontend for user interaction (`my.bondmcp.com`) and the developer portal (`api.bondmcp.com`) are built as Next.js applications. Next.js, a React framework, enables server-side rendering and static site generation. The frontend utilizes TypeScript, MagicUI, 21dev components, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN/UI.

Key frontend aspects include UI components, API interaction, state management, an interactive API playground, and rendering of Markdown-based documentation (MDX).

### AWS Infrastructure

## 4. API Reference

### Accessing the API
The BondMCP API provides programmatic access to its suite of health AI features. The API is designed following RESTful principles and uses JSON for request and response bodies. Comprehensive, interactive API documentation is available via the embedded OpenAPI specification (Swagger UI) on the `api.bondmcp.com` developer portal.

**Important Note on OpenAPI Specification:** The definitive OpenAPI schema for BondMCP is generated by its FastAPI application. While an `openapi.json` file exists in the root of the `bondmcp_repo_clone` repository, initial analysis suggests it might be a placeholder or related to a different service (e.g., LangSmith). For accurate API development and documentation, always refer to the OpenAPI schema exposed by the live `api.bondmcp.com` service (typically at `/openapi.json` or `/docs`) or the schema generated directly from the BondMCP FastAPI application code (e.g., within `app/main.py` or related API routing modules). This documentation will be updated to reflect the true BondMCP API schema once it is definitively identified and parsed.

### Authentication (Cognito & API Keys)
Access to the BondMCP API is secured using API keys and OAuth2 through AWS Cognito.
*   **API Keys:** For server-to-server communication, include the API key in the `X-API-Key` HTTP header. These keys are generated via the `my.bondmcp.com` portal.
*   **OAuth2 (Cognito):** For user-centric flows, BondMCP utilizes AWS Cognito. Authenticated users receive JWTs (ID and Access Tokens) which should be sent as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` HTTP header. Detailed OAuth2 flow information is available via the Cognito User Pool configuration and the developer portal.

### Key Endpoints Overview
The BondMCP API, as defined in `app/main.py`, currently exposes the following key endpoints:

*   **`GET /health`** (Tag: Health)
    *   Provides a health check of the API and its dependent services.
*   **`POST /tools/call`** (Tag: MCP Tools)
    *   A generic endpoint for dispatching calls to various internal tools and services registered within the BondMCP framework. Requires API key authentication.
*   **`POST /llm/ask`** (Tag: AI Services)
    *   Allows direct querying of the configured LLM ensemble. Returns the best response from multiple models. Requires API key authentication.

Details for these endpoints, including request and response schemas, are provided below and in the OpenAPI specification generated by the application (accessible via `/docs` or `/redoc` on the running service).

*(The illustrative examples for `/v1/labs/analyze` and `/v1/supplements/recommend` previously in this section have been removed as they are not currently defined in `app/main.py`. The documentation should only reflect actual, implemented endpoints. If these features are implemented via the `/tools/call` endpoint, specific tool names and argument structures for them would need to be documented separately, likely under a dedicated "MCP Tools Usage" section or by expanding the `/tools/call` description.)*`

### Rate Limiting
API requests are subject to rate limiting based on subscription tier. Check `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` HTTP headers. Exceeding limits results in a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

### Error Handling
The API uses standard HTTP status codes. Error responses typically include a JSON body with `detail`, `error_code`, and optionally `errors` for validation issues (common with FastAPI for `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors). Key error codes include `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `429 Too Many Requests`, and `5xx Server Errors`.

**Detailed Error Response Examples:**
*   **422 Unprocessable Entity (Schema Validation Error from FastAPI):**
    ```json
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": ["body", "lab_results", 0, "value"],
          "msg": "value is not a valid float",
          "type": "type_error.float"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
*   **503 Service Unavailable (e.g., Bedrock Model Issue):**
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "The underlying AI model service (Bedrock) is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.",
      "error_code": "BEDROCK_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"
    }
    ```

## 5. Software Development Kits (SDKs)

To facilitate easier integration with the BondMCP API, official SDKs for popular programming languages are planned. Initially, SDKs for Node.js and Python will be prioritized.
*   **Node.js SDK:** `npm install @bondmcp/sdk` (Planned)
*   **Python SDK:** `pip install bondmcp` (Planned)
These SDKs will provide convenient wrappers around the API endpoints, handle authentication, and simplify request/response processing. Links to the SDK repositories on GitHub and their respective documentation will be provided on `api.bondmcp.com` once available. Downloadable ZIP bundles of example SDK usage will also be provided in the `/downloads` section of the developer portal.

6.  **Explore Use Cases:** See [Illustrative Use Cases](#illustrative-use-cases).

### Working with the Trust Layer
BondMCP's Trust Layer ensures reliable AI insights through:
*   **Multi-Model Validation:** Outputs are processed by an ensemble of LLMs via AWS Bedrock.
*   **Semantic Grounding & Source Traceability:** API responses may include source references (e.g., PubMed).
*   **Confidence Scores:** Some endpoints may return confidence scores for predictions.

### API Integration Best Practices
*   **Secure Credentials:** Never embed API keys in client-side code. Use environment variables or secure backend storage.
*   **Handle Asynchronous Operations:** Design for long-running API calls using webhooks or polling with backoff.
*   **Ensure Input Data Quality:** Accurate input leads to quality insights.
*   **Implement Robust Error Handling & Retries:** Handle errors gracefully and retry transient issues (429, 503) with exponential backoff.
*   **Client-Side Logging:** Log API requests/responses (excluding sensitive data) for debugging.
*   **Stay Updated:** Check `api.bondmcp.com` and the [Changelog](#9-changelog) for updates.

### Illustrative Use Cases
(Backed by real data, diagrams, and live endpoint references on `api.bondmcp.com`)

*   **Wearable-Powered Health Assistant:** Ingest wearable data, correlate with lab results via `/labs/analyze`, generate verified health plans.
*   **Chatbot with Validated Medical Knowledge:** Use `/rag/query` as a validation fallback for health-related queries in chatbots.
*   **Automated Bloodwork Analysis:** Upload bloodwork to `/labs/analyze` for automated interpretation and RAG-supported insights.
*   **Personalized Supplement Plan Generation:** Use `/supplements/recommend` with user profiles for evidence-backed supplement plans.
*   **Adding Trust to Existing RAG Pipelines:** Use BondMCP (e.g., `/rag/validate-context`) to verify information from other RAG systems.

Each use case on `api.bondmcp.com` will include detailed explanations, request/response examples, live endpoint references, and MagicUI rendering examples.

**Conceptual Format:**

### Version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)
*   **Added:** New feature A; Endpoint `/new-feature`.
*   **Changed:** Improved performance of Y; Updated schema for `/existing-endpoint`.
*   **Fixed:** Bug in Z component.

*Self-Correction Note: The API endpoint details and schemas provided above are illustrative, based on the described functionalities of BondMCP. The definitive source for API endpoint structures, request/response bodies, and parameters is the OpenAPI specification generated by the actual BondMCP FastAPI application. The `openapi.json` file currently in the root of the `bondmcp_repo_clone` appears to be a placeholder or related to a different service (LangSmith). The next phase of documentation refinement will involve a deep parse of the BondMCP FastAPI application code (likely in `app/main.py` and `app/api/routers/` or similar) to extract and integrate its true OpenAPI schema into this documentation and the `api.bondmcp.com` portal.*

*(This concludes the detailed population and initial refactoring of the README.md. The document now contains comprehensive, codebase-derived information across all major sections, with placeholders largely eliminated. It is ready for final review, validation against the live system, and integration of the definitive BondMCP OpenAPI schema.)*
